Spending time asking how a friend is doing, and finding out what is new in their life is an important part of Arabic culture. Slow down and
chat before you get down to business.

In Modern Standard Arabic it would be written and pronunced as follows
[\[Reference\]](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81_%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83):

{{< stackedText toWoman >}}
   {{< word "How" "كَيْفَ" "Kayfa" >}}
   {{< word "condition (your)?" "حَالُكِ؟" "haluki?" >}}
{{< /stackedText >}}

{{< stackedText toMan >}}
   {{< word "How" "كَيْفَ" "Kayfa" >}}
   {{< word "condition (your)?" "حَالُكَ؟" "haluka?" >}}
{{< /stackedText >}}

In spoken Levantine Arabic you would say it this way:

{{< stackedText toWoman >}}
   {{< word "How" "كيف" "Keef" >}}
   {{< word "condition (your)?" "حالك؟" "hal-ik?" >}}
{{< /stackedText >}}

{{< stackedText toMan >}}
   {{< word "How" "كيف" "Keef" >}}
   {{< word "condition (your)?" "حالك؟" "hal-ak?" >}}
{{< /stackedText >}}

Note here a pattern, `ik` and `ak` are [singular possesive pronoun suffixes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHuJpemMyiI). There is a great deal more to learn about possesive pronouns in
Arabic which I will try and cover in a later post.

Finally, you will often here a more informal, shortened version of this question, "How are you?", which is pronounced as a single word:

{{< stackedText toWoman >}}
   {{< word "How you?" "كيفك" "keef-ik" >}}
{{< /stackedText >}}

{{< stackedText toMan >}}
   {{< word "How you?" "كيفك" "keef-ak" >}}
{{< /stackedText >}}
