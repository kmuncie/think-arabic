## Different Uses

### Sorry or Excuse Me

This word comes from the verb [عَفَا](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%B9%D9%81%D8%A7#Arabic) which also has a number of meanings such as "to obliterate, to eliminate past mistakes", or put more
simply to "forgive" or "excuse".

عَفْواً is commonly used in situations where you might interject with a "sorry" or "excuse me" in every day speech. Imagine you are having trouble hearing
someone and you say "Sorry?", or you are trying to move past someone in a store aisle and you would normally say "excuse me" as you pass
them.

### You're Welcome

However, it is also common to hear عَفْواً, with the meaning of "you're welcome", used in response to شُكْراً. This does not immediately make sense in connection
with the root definition of the word but does fit in with the norms of many languages where "you're welcome" is the common response to thank you.
This alone has some [interesting history](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/14639/whats-the-origin-of-youre-welcome) in English and other languages.
